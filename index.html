                        <h2 class="w3-right-align">Fabio Quartararo</h2>
                        <p class="w3-justify about">Frenchman Fabio Quartararo got his start in motorcycle racing at the age of four, moving to Spain to develop his career and proclaimed national champion in the 70, 80 and 125 categories. In 2013 he won the FIM CEV Repsol Moto3™ championship and went on to win the same title again in 2014. The previous rule against participating in the Moto3™ World Championship until the age of 16 had been repealed for the winner of the then-national crown, so for 2015 - aged just 15 - Quartararo joined teammate Jorge Navarro in the Estrella Galicia 0,0 Honda team. Impressing from the start, Quartararo was on the podium in just his second race. He repeated that in Assen after claiming pole at both Jerez and Le Mans, but unfortunately a late season ankle injury halted his progress. For 2016 he moved to the Leopard Racing team with KTM machinery, and then moved up to Moto2™ in 2017 with Paginas Amarillas HP40. After some impressive showings of pace, Quartararo moved to Speed Up for his sophomore season in the intermediate class and took his first win - and pole - at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. His move to the premier class surprised many, but what followed in 2019 was nothing short of remarkable: seven podiums, fifth in the Championship and Rookie of the Year with 192 points. His stock continued to rise in 2020, opening up the season with back-to-back victories while securing a third in Barcelona. He lead the chasing pack in the Championship race until a sudden drop off in form cost him dearly and he slipped all the way down to eighth in the standings. The pressure was on straight away for El Diablo in 2021, replacing his hero Valentino Rossi in the factory Yamaha squad, but he didn't disappoint. Victory at Round 2 in Qatar was the springboard he needed and, despite arm pump issues in Jerez and problems with his leathers in Barcelona, he was a reformed character, keeping his cool to put together a memorable season. Four further victories, ten podiums, five pole positions all equalled his, and France's, first MotoGP™ World Championship.</p>

                        <h2 class="w3-left-align">Franco Morbidelli</h2>
                        <p class="w3-justify about">Born in Rome and now living in the motorsport-rich Tavullia, Franco Morbidelli took the Superstock 600 title in 2013 alongside World Championship wildcard outings in Moto2™ at Misano, Motegi and Valencia. He went on to sign with Italtrans Racing Team for a full campaign in 2014 and continued with them in 2015, making his podium debut in Indianapolis. Unfortunately a broken leg sustained during a motocross training session saw him miss several races after Brno, with Morbidelli returning to finish the season but far from fully fit. For 2016 he signed with the highly successful Estrella Galicia 0,0 Marc VDS team and took an incredible run of podium finishes, ending the year just outside the top three in the title fight after an impressive campaign. For 2017, Morbidelli stayed with EG0,0 Marc VDS and came out swinging to take the first three wins of the year - in the lead in the standings during the entire season and taking the title at the Malaysian GP...from STK600 to World Champion in four years. He moved into the premier class within the same EG 0,0 Marc VDS team in 2018 and took the Rookie of the Year honours. 2019 saw Morbidelli join Petronas Yamaha SRT, picking up a solid seven top six finishes. It got even better for the Italian as a masterclass in Misano saw him take a maiden MotoGP™ win, and he added two more in the Teruel and Valencia GPs for a joint best three race wins in 2020, with two more podium finishes seeing him leap to second in the Championship standings. That form saw him among the leading contenders for title glory in 2021, but a knee injury hampered his season. Returning to action at Misano, Morbidelli partnered Fabio Quartararo at Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP after gaining promotion from Petronas Yamaha SRT. The Italian signed a deal to remain a factory Yamaha rider until at least the end of 2023. But he must find a marked improvement if he's to remain in blue much longer following a disastrous 2022 that saw the Italian finish inside the top ten just twice all year.</p>

                            <h2 class="w3-right-align">Enea Bastianini</h2>
                            <p class="w3-justify about">Enea Bastianini was victorious in two races of the 2013 Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup and combined his participation in that with five rides in the Italian national Moto3™ championship. Bastianini turned 16 at the end of 2013 and arrived in the World Championship in 2014 to ride with the Junior Team GO&FUN Moto3™ of Fausto Gresini on a KTM. He impressed in his rookie season as he hit the podium three times, staying with the team for 2015, but on a Honda. In 2015 he challenged for the title in the early stages of the year, taking his first victory on the world stage at home in Misano as well as five additional podiums. He remained with the Gresini team and on Honda machinery, and was second in the Championship in 2016. For 2017, Bastianini changed to Estrella Galicia 0,0 and had a more difficult year, gaining traction in the latter stages and taking a pole and three podiums. For 2018 he replaced outgoing reigning Champion Joan Mir at Leopard Racing, finishing fourth in the Championship after six podium finishes, including one victory. 2020 saw Bastianini become a World Champion as he took the Moto2™ crown. A podium finish in Qatar helped him launch his title attack, but it really took flight after back to back victories in the Andalusian and Czech GPs before a victory and podium finish in Misano helped cement his place among the leading contenders. From there, Bastianini only once failed to break into the Top 6 places, including podiums in the Aragon double, and it was that consistency that saw him become a World Champion. 2021 brought a new challenge, and one he thrived in. Bastianini, despite being one of only three men to be on older machinery, was one of the breakout stars of the season, with a double podium in Misano just reward for his brilliant late-season form. The Beast jumped on Pecco Bagnaia's 2021 Ducati in 2022 and moved across to the Gresini Racing team. He was without doubt the surprise package of 2022, claiming a quite remarkable four victories to help him clinch third in the standings. It all started in Qatar, then backed up in Austin and Le Mans, before he beat out Bagnaia in a sensational last lap showdown in Aragon. His performances have earned him a dream move to the factory Ducati squad for 2023 where a mouth-watering head-to-head battle with World Champion Bagnaia will begin.</p>

                            <h2 class="w3-left-align">Francesco Bagnaia</h2>
                            <p class="w3-justify about">Italian Francesco Bagnaia moved to the highly competitive CEV Championship in Spain in 2010, and he came third overall that year. He was reconfirmed for the Monlau Competicion team for 2012 and won another race before the step up to the World Championship, where he partnered Roman Fenati in the Team Italia FMI in 2013. For 2014 he switched teams as well as machinery as he lined up for the Sky Racing Team VR46 on a KTM, and 2015 brought another new challenge with the new Aspar Team Mahindra. Ending the year as the top Mahindra rider, the Italian was also frequently involved in the podium battle, retaining his seat for 2016 and going on to take not only a maiden win in Assen, but also a second win in Sepang. Earning a test ride on the team’s MotoGP™ machine in Valencia at the end of the season, Bagnaia moved up to Moto2™ in 2017 with the new Sky Racing Team VR46 intermediate class effort and was Rookie of the Year, taking several podiums. In 2018 he hit the ground running and was a contender for the crown from the off, with some incredible wins and consistency seeing him eventually take the title in Malaysia. Impressive in his first outings in the premier class in testing, Bagnaia moved up to MotoGP™ with Pramac Racing in 2019. It was a difficult rookie year for Bagnaia but a fantastic P4 in Australia showed plenty signs of promise. 2020 proved a mixed year for the Italian and his GP-20. He earned an impressive second place in the San Marino GP and a week later at the same track, he was on the verge of a maiden premier class victory until a heartbreaking slide off the track ended his hopes. He never quite got going again in the remaining races but 2021 brought renewed hope for Pecco in the factory squad. Three podiums and a pole at the opening four rounds signalled the Italian as a title contender and, despite a blip in the middle of the season, he finished the year as the form man of the Championship. A debut MotoGP™ win came at Aragon after an incredible head-to-head with Marc Marquez, and he backed it up with victory in Misano a week after. His title charge slipped through his fingers with a crash during our second visit to Misano, but he did add victories at the final two rounds of the year. The Italian's 2022 season got off to a slow start and a crash at the Sachsenring left him 91 points away from the Championship lead, before a stellar run in the second half of the campaign, including four straight race wins and seven for the year in total, saw Bagnaia do what once seemed impossible and clinch the crown in Valencia.</p>

As a Moto2™ rookie in 2014, Viñales was again Rookie of the Year and won four races – moving up to MotoGP™ the year after with Team Suzuki Ecstar. Another Rookie of the Year trophy followed, before the Spaniard then took Suzuki’s first race win since 2007 – and his maiden MotoGP™ win – at the British GP in 2016. For 2017, Viñales moved to Movistar Yamaha MotoGP to partner none other than Italian legend Valentino Rossi. After dominating pre-season testing, the Yamaha rider won the first two races of the year and the French GP, but the Movistar Yamaha team’s struggles with low grip then saw a more difficult latter half of the season. Viñales came third overall, and the struggles continued into 2018. It was the Spaniard who brought Yamaha's longest losing streak to an end, however, as he won in Australia. 2019 started slowly for Viñales, picking up just the solitary podium in the first seven races. However, victory at Assen then put the wheels in motion for a fantastic latter half of the season. Five podiums, including a win in Malaysia, saw Viñales claim P3 in the Championship. 2020 brought hopes of a title attack for Viñales, and he was in contention from the very beginning thanks to successive second places in the Jerez double, while victory at the Emilia Romagna GP bolstered his hopes. However, inconsistent form and an inability to follow up on promising Qualifying sessions saw the Spaniard slip out of the title race and finish 6th in the Championship. 2021, his fifth year at Yamaha, started in remarkable fashion with victory at the opening round. But the relationship deteriorated from there in unprecedented circumstances. 24 hours on from a podium in Assen, it was announced he'd leave Yamaha at the end of the season, one year earlier than planned, but he didn't even make it to Valencia. After over-revving his engine in Austria, Yamaha sacked the Spaniard with immediate effect. Rumours began to grow that he'd sign for Aprilia and, before long, that deal was announced and he was testing the RS-GP in Misano. The Noale factory handed him the final five rounds of the year to adapt to the new machine and prepare for a hugely important 2022 campaign. A challenging first half to the season had many questioning if the Aprilia switch would be a success before three podiums in the space of four rounds - Assen, Silverstone and Misano - changed the narrative entirely. With a new two-year deal in his back pocket, Top Gun will have his sights set on being a regular front runner in 2023.</p>

                            <p class="w3-justify about">Aleix Espargaro was the youngest ever rider to win the 125cc Spanish National Championship when he claimed the title in 2004, before moving onto the world stage the year after. After taking his first World Championship podium in Moto2™ in 2011, 2012 saw Espargaro graduate to MotoGP™ and claim the title of Champion in the CRT category – before repeating the feat in 2013. Top “Open” rider the year after, and on the podium at MotorLand Aragon, Espargaro then joined the factory Suzuki team in 2015, hauling more points and a pole position at the Catalan GP. In 2017, Espargaro moved to Aprilia Racing Team Gresini and took some top results for the Noale factory, including a best of sixth in both Qatar and Aragon. Progressively cutting the gap to the front, Espargaro remained with Aprilia in 2018 but it was off to a tough start before they made some big progress in the latter half of the year. Remaining with the team in 2019, Espargaro earned a best result of P7 on an unfavoured RS-GP, a result he couldn’t quite match during 2020, as despite being a consistent Top 10 challenger, he finished 17th overall in the Championship. He continued for a fifth season with Aprilia in 2021 and his hard work was rewarded with a much-improved RS-GP. He later became the Noale squad's history-maker by taking their debut MotoGP™ podium in Silverstone. 2022 would turn into a year he'll never forget, as Espargaro fought for the World Championship for the first time in his career. A career-first Grand Prix victory in Argentina kickstarted a season that included five further podium visits. A disappointing final five rounds saw the Spaniard slip out of title contention and the Championship top three, but he looks set to once again challenge at the front in 2023.</p>

                            <h2 class="w3-right-align">Takaaki Nakagami</h2>
                            <p class="w3-justify about">A product of the Red Bull MotoGP Academy initiative, Nakagami became the youngest ever winner of the Japanese 125cc Championship in 2006, and in 2007 he entered the Spanish series under the Academy banner. In the World Championship in 2008, he achieved his best result of the year with a top ten finish at Donington and he continued in the Championship in 2009. Stepping away from the World Championship for two years, he won the Japanese Moto2™ title in 2011 and was drafted in by the Italtrans team at the Japan GP as a substitute rider. The team offered him a full-time seat for 2012, and in 2013 just missed out on a maiden race victory on numerous occasions - not least when he scored four consecutive second place finishes in the middle of the season. He switched to Idemitsu Honda Team Asia for 2014 but had a tough year, before a return to the podium with third in Misano the following year. He remained with the team in 2016 and took his first win in Assen at the Dutch GP, and by the end of 2017 had garnered eight podiums and two poles. For 2018 Nakagami graduated to the premier class to ride with LCR Honda Idemitsu, and was the best qualifying rookie with several appearances in Q2. 2019 saw Nakagami stay with LCR Honda Idemitsu on a 2018 RC213V, and the Japanese rider strung a solid season together, claiming nine Top 10s and a best finish of P5 at Mugello. Shoulder surgery ended Nakagami’s season after the Japanese GP. His fourth season in the premier class saw him improve even further, placing inside the Top 10 in every race with the exception of Teruel, where he earned a first pole position, and the Valencia GPs. Another year with LCR but it was another of missed opportunity for Nakagami. HRC's struggles certainly didn't help but crashes in key moments saw the Japanese rider end the year with two top five finishes. It was the same story in 2022 as Honda's radically new machine failed to deliver an upturn in results. A best finish of seventh sees him fighting for his MotoGP™ future in 2023.</p>

                            <p class="w3-justify about">Alex Rins won the CEV in 2011 before moving up to the Moto3™ World Championship in 2012 and gaining the title of Rookie of the Year. A title contender down to the last corner in 2013 after more wins and podiums, the Spaniard was just beaten to the crown by compatriot Maverick Viñales. After a more difficult 2014 affected slightly by injury, Rins moved to Moto2™ for 2015 and was Rookie of the Year, taking wins in his debut season in the intermediate class. A title challenger in 2016, the former national Champion finished the season in third after more impressive wins and podiums, and moved up to MotoGP™ in 2017 with Team Suzuki Ecstar. Despite some trouble with injury and missed races, Rins was impressive and took some top five results as a rookie – a good springboard for his sophomore season. He went on to take five podiums in 2018 and consistently fight at the front; another solid foundation for 2019. The next step was made in 2019 as Rins claimed a maiden MotoGP™ victory at the Americas GP, before repeating the feat in Silverstone. 2020 was another outstanding year for the Spaniard as he claimed victory in the Aragon GP as well as podium finishes in the Catalan, Teruel and European GPs, helping him claim 3rd overall in the Championship. 2021 was a year to forget for Rins, with crashes at crucial times costing him dearly. He threw away opportunities on no fewer than six occasions, tasting podium success once at the British GP. The Spaniard bounced back in 2022, delivering some superb performances despite real adversity. Top of the Championship after five rounds, Suzuki's exit hit the team hard resulting in a dip in form. But magnificent wins at Phillip Island and Valencia saw Rins finish the season as the form man, giving him great confidence heading into 2023 with the LCR Honda outfit.</p>

                            <p class="w3-justify about">Former Red Bull Rookies Cup winner Johann Zarco made the jump into the 125cc World Championship in 2009, becoming runner-up to the title in 2011 with Aki Ajo’s team before transitioning to Moto2™. Over the next three years, he achieved six podiums in the intermediate class before moving back to partner Ajo in his Moto2™ team, winning the Championship in 2015 and becoming the first man to successfully defend the Moto2™ crown since its introduction in 2010 when he took the honours again in 2016. The first Frenchman to win more than one World Championship, Zarco moved into MotoGP™ for 2017 and made an impressive debut with three podiums and two pole positions in his rookie year. He stayed with Monster Yamaha Tech 3 in 2018 and took more podiums, ending the season as top Independent Team rider. In 2019 he made the move to Red Bull KTM Factory Racing to become part of the Austrian factory's assault on the premier class. However, after an incredibly difficult opening half the season, Zarco decided to walk away from the orange brand less than halfway through his two-year deal. Then a free agent, he stepped in for Takaaki Nakagami at LCR Honda Idemitsu for the final three rounds of the season, before a move to Reale Avinita Racing opened up. He represented Ducati and Esponsorama Racing with aplomb in 2020, securing a podium finish in the Czech GP, and was promoted to the Pramac Racing team for 2021. The Frenchman had a season of two halves with Pramac, starting in magnificent fashion. Back-to-back podiums in Qatar saw him lead the premier class standings for the first time, with further podiums at Le Mans and Catalunya. But arm pump woes in the second half of 2021 saw his title charge tail away, eventually finishing fifth in the standings. He remained with Pramac for 2022 but that elusive first victory still evaded him. Four rostrums and two poles last season means he's now the rider with the most poles and the rider with the most podiums to never have taken a premier class win. Will we finally see a backflip in 2023?</p>

                            <p class="w3-justify about">Jorge Martin joined the Red Bull Rookies Cup for the 2012 season. Unfortunately it was a season plagued by various injuries, but the following year he tried again and finished runner-up behind the 2013 champion Karel Hanika. In 2014 he dominated the same Championship and took the crown. For 2015 Martín took the next step and participated in his first full season in the Moto3™ World Championship, where he joined the Mahindra Mapfre Aspar team. An awesome seventh in Aragon helped the Spaniard to finish the year 17th overall, with he and the Aspar team electing to continue their relationship for 2016. For 2017, the Spaniard moved to Del Conca Gresini Racing Moto3 to replace outgoing title contender Enea Bastianini. The master of qualifying and on pole for half the entire season, Martin took an impressive nine podiums despite a mid-season injury, and his maiden win in the season finale on the way to P4 overall. His stellar year would arrive in 2018 as Martin beat Marco Bezzecchi to the Moto3™ crown, claiming seven victories despite picking up another mid-season injury. Red Bull KTM Ajo in Moto2™ became the Spaniards home in 2019, and he rewarded his new team with podium finishes in Japan and Austria toward the tail end of the season. A title charge awaited in 2020, a Spanish GP podium followed up with a victory and podium finish in the Spielberg double, he was right in the Championship mix. However, a positive Covid-19 test meant he missed the Misano double, and successive retirements put to bed any plans of the Championship. There were three more podiums in the final five Grand Prix, including victory in Valencia, which helped him secure fifth place in the standings. 2021 brought a move up to MotoGP™ with Pramac Racing on a GP21, and it's safe to say Martin hit the ground running. A debut pole and podium were secured in Doha before a huge crash in Portimao saw him break eight bones. Missing four races, Martin returned and after the summer break, in Austria, a first victory was his. Two more podiums helped Martin secure the Rookie of the Year crown, and in 2022, the Spaniard was tipped for greatness. Martin was the pole master of 2022, smashing lap records left, right and centre to take five Saturday honours throughout the year. But failed to convert any of them into victory and was unable to build on an excellent rookie campaign. The Spaniard is a wounded animal heading into 2023 after being overlooked for the factory Ducati seat and will be looking to bite back immediately.</p>
